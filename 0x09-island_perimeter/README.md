<p><h1>0x09. Island Perimeter :fire:</h1></p>

## Description :house:
In this projected I calculated the perimeter of an island using girds.<br>

## Task
[0. Island Perimeter](./0-island_perimeter.py)<br>
Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid)`: that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:<br>

`grid `is a list of list of integers:<br>
0 represents water<br>
1 represents land<br>
Each cell is square, with a side length of `1`<br>
Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).<br>
`grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100<br>
The `grid `is completely surrounded by water<br>
There is only one island (or nothing).<br>
The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
